# Objective:  
In this project we have created a Information Visualization pipeline to provide insights and details about sales and also adding interaction such as brushing and linking. category filter and range selection filter.

# About Dataset:  
The Walmart Sales dataset is a comprehensive collection that provides a detailed look at the sales performance of 45 different Walmart stores across various regions from 2010 to 2012. It includes crucial weekly sales data segmented by department, which helps in understanding the dynamics of retail sales over time. The dataset is enriched with additional variables that influence sales, such as store type, which includes categorizations like Supercenter or Discount Store, and external factors like temperature, fuel prices, Consumer Price Index (CPI), and unemployment rates.

# Methodology:
## Data Cleaning and Validation:
  Before we proceed to create a dashboard using Altair it is essential for us to verify the data is accurate and free of any anomalies. This step allow us to  not only make the dashboard less prone to crash but also makes the basis for the data cleaning pipeline.
